The senator of Alaska stated, \u201cAs I often say, Alaska is a resource-rich but infrastructure-poor state. The Port of Alaska is critical for Alaska\u2019s supply chain and America\u2019s national security,\u201d She later stated, \u201cThese infrastructure improvements will provide several Alaska communities with the ability to safely and efficiently transport goods to and from their communities, benefitting both local communities and the national supply chain.\u201d Infrastructure and food insecurity has been a problem across the state. With the aid of the projects and improvement, this can potentially lighten, pushing them a step forward towards a solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-6h3bo\">California is another top recipient of these grants and plan to use these funds across 6 projects. As seen in headlines since 2021, California ports have been notorious for being congested. The sense of urgency to help California and its ports will unequivocally be helped through these funds. Aside from using the funds for capacity issues, they will also be using $30.1 million towards implementing electric tractors and phasing out diesel tractors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"viewer-2kc3r\">Just as Alaska and California will benefit greatly from these funds so will the other 20 recipients of these grants. The Biden administration have taken initiative in prioritizing the nations ports and supply chain terminals with an overall bigger picture of aiding with clean air and the benefit of the surrounding communities in mind.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Announced late last week the US DOT made public that they will be funding 41 projects [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":187,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[1],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-297","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-uncategorized"],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.10 -
